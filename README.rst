Definitions of Pardon jargon to help Python beginners understand Pythonista gobbletigook

Data
----

.. _value:

Value
  A single piece of data, like ``3`` or ``'Fluffy'``

String
  A piece of text data, like ``'hello'``.  Enclosing it
  in quotation marks
  tells Python that it's a string and not something like
  a variable name.

Float
  Short for *floating-point number*, a number with a
  decimal point.

.. _variable:

Variable
  A piece of data that has a name.

  ::

      cat_name = 'Fluffy'

  Now ``cat_name`` is a *variable* with the value 'Fluffy'.

Assign
  Give a name to a value_, making a variable_.
  
Dunder
  The two underscores before and after a method name to indicate that it is "magic", i.e. __init__, __new__, etc.

Magic Method
  Methods that can be used to change the normal behavior of an object. HINT : in Python, everything is an object.
  
Object
  A logical grouping of methods, expressions, variables, and functions.

Expression
  In Python, this is basically a list of commands that need to be evaluated and executed. Typically, these fit on one line, but there is a way for an expression to take up more than one line. 





API
  Shorthand for "application programmer interface". This is a way to pass messages back and forth in order to add functionality to a program. Examples include POSIX (the unix/Linux API), Win32, Cocoa, Amazon AWS, and Android. However, many other services have APIs to add things like (for instance) Dropbox and Facebook to your app.    

IDE
  Shorthand for "Integrated Development Evnvironment". This is a program that lets you build more programs. Examples include Eclipse, Sublime, Wingware, and IDLE

Deploy
  To deliver a completed program so that other people can use it. Ususually different than just programming it so that it works. Sometimes, a program needs to be installed in a package, or through an App Store, or maybe it just needs to be on the web. That last step to make it so that other people can reach it is called "deployment"
